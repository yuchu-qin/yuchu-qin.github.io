## Biography

I am a [Lecturer in Applied Artificial Intelligence](https://business.leeds.ac.uk/faculty/staff/2083/dr-peizhi-shi) at the Centre for Decision Research, University of Leeds. In March 2019, I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science under the supervision of [Dr. Ke Chen](https://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~kechen/index.php) from the Machine Learning and Optimization Group, School of Computer Science, University of Manchester. From 2019 to 2023, I served as a Research Fellow in Machine Learning at the Maths Group of the EPSRC Future Advanced Metrology Hub. 

My research interests include **machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), and their real-world applications**, particularly in sustainable manufacturing, design for additive manufacturing, and production research. I have been conducting research in machine learning for over ten years and have authored or co-authored {{site.publications | size}} papers in leading journals in my field, such as IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing, Virtual and Physical Prototyping, Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, Computers & Industrial Engineering, and Cognitive Computation.
