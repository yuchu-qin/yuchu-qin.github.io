## Biography

I am a [Senior Researcher](https://pure.hud.ac.uk/en/persons/yuchu-qin) in Geometrical Product Design, Manufacturing, and Measurement with the [EPSRC Future Advanced Metrology Hub for Sustainable Manufacturing](https://research.hud.ac.uk/institutes-centres/cpt/). I hold a BEng and an MEng in Computer Science and two PhDs in Mechanical Engineering. I was appointed as a full-time Researcher in June 2021 and promoted to a full-time Senior Researcher in September 2024. I have engaged in teaching undergraduate and master’s students and supervising/co-supervising PhD students since September 2023. I have authored/co-authored 60+ journal papers (including 30+ first-author journal papers). I am a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy, a Member of the EPSRC Peer Review College, an Expert Reviewer of AHRC Funding Applications, an Editorial Team Member for 6 journals, and a Peer Reviewer for 60+ journals.
